<h1 align='center'>Arcanum: New Spells</h1>
<h2 align='center'>A modification for the classic RPG game "Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura".</h2>

&nbsp;

<p>Introducing the first mod for the game that replaces certain unpopular spells with ones with new spell effects and more complex combinations of spell visuals to the game. While spell replacers already existed, as far as I know this is the first one editing them to such extent.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the way the game is set up it's very hard and often impossible to add much new content without access to the source code so I had to struggle pushing the spell settings file to it's limit. For example
the original Harden Hands spell seems to have it's damage hardcoded. The spell itself just adds a flag to the affected creature and the engine adds the extra hand to hand damage when the flag is on. At first I thought it would run a script but 
I was unable to find any scripts that would correspond to the spell, so it really seems to be done by the engine. </p> &nbsp;

<p>I've noticed while going through the game files that the developers had alot of interesting ideas that never made it to the game. Sadly the engine doesn't even have the capabilities to make them work. For example there are several gauntlets with unique OnHit script effects 
that will never work because game doesn't recognize hits from armor, only weapons. There are also many unique weapons with unique scripts that were never added but exist in the files. That said, in the future I'm planning on experimenting more with the scripting language used with items and flags.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>This mod doesn't use any actual scripting language but simple editing of the spell structure setting files. Figuring out the structure, possibilities and adding the effect combinations in a way that work was not so simple though. Often when I thought I had it figured out, things stopped working the way I expected them to. </p>

## üéØ New Possible Effects
- Summoning usable items, such as weapons and armor.
- Spawning scenery objects with collisions such as rocks, lights or non summon creatures/npcs.
- On screen teleportation while spawning scenery + affecting/damaging nearby creatures.
- Summon walls but in a radius instead of a line.
- Reused art assets from nonspell effects to create new ones.

<p>Note: While some spells have simple structure, they are made unique through the use of their visual effects.</p>
